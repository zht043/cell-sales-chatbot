Comprising a 50MP f/1.8 main shooter with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 10MP f/2.0 telephoto camera with 3.2x optical zoom, and a 12MP f/2.2 ultrawide sensor, the Xiaomi 13’s camera setup makes the phone a much more versatile beast for photographers; primarily because Xiaomi’s Leica partnership allows for two distinct shooting modes: Vibrant and Authentic. The former makes colors look brighter and more saturated, while the latter replicates the original Leica look by encouraging bolder contrast and a greater dynamic range, which proves a nice differentiator between this and other Android phones.\\xa0\\nIf you’re looking for one of the very best camera phones, though, the Xiaomi 13 still doesn’t hold a candle to the photography performance offered by its Pro-grade sibling – the Xiaomi 13 Pro – or the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro.\\xa0\\nThe bottom line is this: the Xiaomi 13 is an excellent flagship option for Android fans with a soft spot for Apple’s design philosophy. It doesn’t beat the competition in any one area, but Xiaomi’s latest premium offering still delivers almost everything you could want from a smartphone to an extremely high standard.\\nFor those looking to spend a little more money, our hands-on Xiaomi 13 Pro review may shed some light on whether the jump up to Xiaomi’s even-more premium photography-focused handset is worth it.\\n\",\n",
       " \"There is a review Hands on: Xiaomi 13 Lite review – the Civi's new suit: A Civi by any other name... that  indicating The Xiaomi 13 Lite certainly feels like the odd-one-out in the Xiaomi 13 series, and not only because it's a mid-ranger in what is otherwise a family of flagships. Despite packing older hardware and a borrowed design than its launch siblings, though, there are some subtle charms to this latest Lite.\\n\\nPros\\n\\n+Thin and lightweight design+Standout selfie camera setup+Fast 67W wired charging\\n\\nCons\\n\\n-Launches on the older Android 12-No IP rating or wireless charging\\n, with details Xiaomi had a lot to shout about at its February 26 launch event in Barcelona. Most notably, the Xiaomi 13 and Xiaomi 13 Pro made their international debut after having previously launched exclusively in China, late last year. There was, however, one additional surprise entrant in tow that, prior to this, we'd heard very little about – the Xiaomi 13 Lite.\\nAt a glance, the Lite is a bit of an oddball, an outlier in the Xiaomi 13 series. For one, it doesn't get any special Leica treatment like its series siblings – with regards to its triple rear sensor setup. It also looks very different compared to both the Xiaomi 13 and 13 Pro, with their sizeable squared rear camera bump.\\nIn truth, the phone clearly takes its design cues from the previous Xiaomi 12 series more so than the company's current flagship line and there's a particular device, already within Xiaomi's portfolio, that bears more than a passing resemblance to the new 13 Lite.\\nIt would seem that the Xiaomi 13 Lite looks to be a repackaged Xiaomi Civi 2, which debuted in China in the latter half of 2022. The Xiaomi 13 Lite sports the same slim and lightweight design, runs on the same Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset, and boasts the same specialist features; like dual front-facing LED flashes to offer what the company calls 'Xiaomi Selfie Glow'.\\nIn fact, despite running on Android 12 – while the Xiaomi 13 and 13 Pro arrive with Android 13 – the Xiaomi 13 Lite does join them on the company's latest MIUI 14 user experience.\\nWhile there's no Leica involvement in the camera system, the main 50MP sensor still looks to be an impressive offering at first blush (it's the same Sony IMX766 found in the likes of the Xiaomi 12), while the secondary 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro look a little more pedestrian and expected, considering the phone's mid-range standing.\\nIn a decidedly iPhone 14 Pro-style move, the front 32MP camera is accompanied by a secondary 8MP depth sensor that together sit within a pill-shaped cutout in the top center of the display in a way that screams 'Dynamic Island'. However, don't expect iOS-like functionality here.\\nIn truth, the design may be Lite's biggest selling point. Despite sitting in the middle of the Xiaomi 13 series in terms of screen size, at 6.55-inches (in between the Xiaomi 13's 6.36-inch display and the 13 Pro's 6.73-inch display), the 13 Lite is both notably thinner at 7.2mm (versus 8mm or 8.4mm) and lighter, at 171 grams (versus 185 grams and 210 grams, respectively).\\nEven with that snatched waistline, the 13 Lite still manages to sequester the same 4,500mAh capacity battery as the standard Xiaomi 13, along with the same 67W fast wired charging. What you do lose out on is any form of wireless charging tech. However, with a full charge promised in 40 minutes, that seems like a minor hardship.\\nProvided you don't need flagship performance or camera prowess, the 13 Lite looks to be a capable-enough mid-ranger, with some unique touches in an attractive, lightweight design. You'll have to check back for a full assessment though.\\nIn the meantime, read on for more insights into what the Xiaomi 13 Lite has to offer, and why not check out our Xiaomi 13 review and hands-on Xiaomi 13 Pro review, as well as a rundown of the best Xiaomi phones currently out there.\\n\",\n",

The best phones on the global stage, like the iPhone 14 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, have a new contender to worry about; one that doesn\\'t mess around, based on my initial time with the Xiaomi 13 Pro.\\nAlthough it\\'s intended as a direct successor to Xiaomi 12 Pro, one of the 13 Pro\\'s biggest selling points (that new Leica-branded camera system) is actually a direct continuation of the technology first seen in the China-exclusive Xiaomi 12S Ultra that we encountered later into 2022, in August.\\nOur first taste of the company\\'s newly-minted relationship with the optical wizards at Leica, mated with Sony\\'s sizeable 1-inch IMX989 sensor and Xiaomi\\'s own image processing, proved to be a recipe for success; impressing reviewer Basil Kronfli, who described the 12S Ultra as \"the best camera phone I\\'ve used.\"\\nWith such lofty praise, the 12S Ultra\\'s absence from the international market felt like a crying shame, making the Xiaomi 13 Pro\\'s fresh international release all the more significant.\\nThat killer camera setup, features a trio of 50MP rear sensors, including a 3.2x telephoto with a floating lens arrangement. The Xiaomi 13 Pro also comes with a ceramic-backed body, plus Qualcomm\\'s latest and greatest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile chipset, with faster and more efficient memory and storage than its predecessor.\\nFor charging, we get the same impressive 120W wired, 50W wireless and 10W reverse wireless charging as before, but this time paired to a larger, 4,820mAh battery. Nice.\\nAlthough the verdict is still out on whether this is one of the best Android phones of the year, it certainly has the makings of a great flagship device, one that I can\\'t wait to sink my teeth into for a full review, so don\\'t forget to check back soon for a final verdict.\\nIn the meantime, read on for my hands-on experiences with the Xiaomi 13 Pro, and if you\\'re curious about its smaller-but-still-potent launch sibling, we also have a Xiaomi 13 review for you to enjoy too.\\n']"
