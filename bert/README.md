# Dataset

Based on phone1.json from Ning Zichun

#### phone1.json:

```json
{
    "instruction": "What are the best budget phones under $200?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Some of the best budget phones under $200 include the Moto G Play (2021), Nokia 2.4, Samsung Galaxy A01, LG K40, and Xiaomi Redmi 9A."
}
```

In preprocessing, the format converted to the same as SQuAD 2.0. Also, the questions and answers are generated by chatGPT-4 based on the context of phone1.json. The "answer_start" is recalculated due to the error of chatGPT-4.
